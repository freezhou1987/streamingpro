# Built-in Estimator/Transformer

MLSQL has a lot of Estimator/Transformer to help people resolve some problems which is not good for SQL.
 
Estimator will learn data and generate a model. Transformer is data in data out. So algorithm is estimator, and 
the model generated by the estimator is transformer. Any data processing component is also a transformer.

MLSQL accept these concepts and terminologies. We can use Estimator/Transformer(ET)  to provide function beyond SQL.
