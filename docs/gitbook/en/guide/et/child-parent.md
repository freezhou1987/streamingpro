# Parent-Child relationship computing

It's difficult to compute the parent-child relationship with SQL. In most case, we have scenario as followingï¼š

1. Specify one node, get all child nodes of any level.
2. Specify one node, get the depth. 
3. Return one or more tree-like structure.

Suppose the data we will process is like this:

```sql
set jsonStr = '''
{"id":0,"parentId":null}
{"id":1,"parentId":null}
{"id":2,"parentId":1}
{"id":3,"parentId":3}
{"id":7,"parentId":0}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
{"id":199,"parentId":1}
{"id":200,"parentId":199}
{"id":201,"parentId":199}
''';
```

You can load this text with jsonStr:

```sql
load jsonStr.`jsonStr` as data;
```

Using ET TreeBuildExt to compute the relationship:

```sql
run data as TreeBuildExt.`` 
where idCol="id" 
and parentIdCol="parentId" 
and treeType="nodeTreePerRow" 
as result;
```

Here are the result:

```
+---+-----+------------------+
|id |level|children          |
+---+-----+------------------+
|200|0    |[]                |
|0  |1    |[7]               |
|1  |2    |[200, 2, 201, 199]|
|7  |0    |[]                |
|201|0    |[]                |
|199|1    |[200, 201]        |
|2  |0    |[]                |
+---+-----+------------------+
```

children includes nodes of all levels.

We can also compute the sub tree of evey node:

```sql
run data as TreeBuildExt.`` 
where idCol="id" 
and parentIdCol="parentId" 
and treeType="treePerRow" 
as result;
```

result:

```
+----------------------------------------+---+--------+-----+
|children                                |id |parentID|level|
+----------------------------------------+---+--------+-----+
|[[[], 7, 0]]                            |0  |null    |1    |
|[[[[[], 200, 199]], 199, 1], [[], 2, 1]]|1  |null    |2    |
+----------------------------------------+---+--------+-----+
```

children is a row, and you can use UDF to process it.
